# Media-Stream
📝 Summary:
This project involves the development of a database system for a global streaming company, MediaStream, to manage users, subscriptions, payments, and multimedia content. The database was implemented using Oracle Database, covering logical and physical design, background processes, memory management, and recovery operations.

The system stores user data, payment records, subscription plans, and multimedia content (music and videos), tracking playback history, ratings, and comments. It also manages device registrations, playlists, and account-sharing rules based on subscription plans. Advanced data structures ensure efficient handling of streaming sessions, playback tracking, and content metadata. 🚀
